# phenometrics

S2_clip contains test data. The dataset is incomplete! 

THE CLUSTER SCRIPT:
phenometrics.py

FOR ANALYSIS:
1. Script to plot graphs for a few pixels: first run phenometrics_pixel_out with a selection of pixels. In order to do so, change the constants at the top of the jupyter notebook
second: run the second notebook, phenometrics_pixel_to_graph to get the pixels plotted

2. Analysis of the satellite imagery. The script plot_slice_over_time plots one pixel row or column of all input images. The plots display the accuracy/ shift of pixels
